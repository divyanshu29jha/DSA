Subsequences: Elements in same order as in original array but non-contagious elements allowed.

Subarray: Elements in same order as in original array and only contiguous elements allowed.

Power Set: Elements may be in different order as in original array and non-contagious elements allowed. Set of all subsets of an array.
Subset: Elements may be in different order as in original array and non-contagious elements allowed.




All possible patters from Subsequence:

1. Print all the distinct Subsequence --> Parameter wise
2. Print all Subsequence which sums to K --> Parameter wise
3. Print only 1st Subsequence which sums to K --> Return true/false based on sum==k and avoid further recursion calls if you get true.
4. Print the count of all Subsequence which sums to K  --> Return 0/1 based on sum==k and add all recursion calls f() i.e l+r here.

i.e
Better String [Print all distinct Subsequences]
[Check if there exists a subsequence with sum K]
Perfect Sum Problem [Count all subsequences with sum K]
